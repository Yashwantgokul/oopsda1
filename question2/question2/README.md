# Question 2 - Sales Analysis Using 2D Array in C

## Problem Statement

In a small company there are 5 salesmen and each salesman sells 3 products.  
Write a program using a two-dimensional array to:

(i) Calculate the total sales by each salesman  
(ii) Calculate the total sales of each product  

---

## Approach

- A 2D array is used to store sales data of salesmen and products.
- Rows represent salesmen and columns represent products.
- Nested loops are used to input and calculate totals.
- Separate loops calculate:
  - Total sales by each salesman
  - Total sales of each product

---

## Constants Used

SALESMEN = 5  
PRODUCTS = 3  

---

## Program File

solution.c

---

## Sample Output

Total Sales by Each Salesman  
Salesman 1 : 250  
Salesman 2 : 300  

Total Sales of Each Product  
Product 1 : 400  
Product 2 : 350

## How to Compile and Run

gcc solution.c -o solution  
./solution  

---

## Concepts Used

- Two-dimensional arrays  
- Nested loops  
- Summation using loops  
- Input and output in C
