# Question 1 - Highest Marks Using 2D Array in C

## Problem Statement

Write a program to read a two-dimensional array `marks` which stores marks of 
5 students in 3 subjects.  
Display the highest marks in each subject.

---

## Approach

- A 2D array is used to store marks for each subject and student.
- Nested loops are used to take input.
- Another array `highest` is used to track the maximum marks for each subject.
- The program updates the highest value while taking input.

---

## Program Code

The solution is written in C and stored in:

solution.c

---

## Constants Used

SUBJECTS = 3  
STUDENTS = 5  

---

## Output

The program displays the highest marks obtained in each subject.

Example:

Subject 1 : 85  
Subject 2 : 92  
Subject 3 : 88

## How to Compile and Run

gcc solution.c -o solution  
./solution  

---

## Concepts Used

- Two-dimensional arrays  
- Nested loops  
- Conditional statements  
- Input and output in C
