# Question 3 - Student Marks Analysis Using Arrays in C

## Problem Statement

In a class there are 20 students. Each student appears in:

- Three tests
- Two quizzes

Write a program to:

- Store names of all students
- Store marks of three tests and two quizzes using arrays
- Calculate total marks of each student
- Calculate average marks of each student
- Display the results

## Approach

- A 2D character array is used to store student names
- Five separate arrays store marks of:
  - Test 1
  - Test 2
  - Test 3
  - Quiz 1
  - Quiz 2
- Total is calculated by adding all marks
- Average is calculated by dividing total by 5
